# Configuration

renga reads an optional TOML file at startup. This document is the **canonical reference** for the config keys, their defaults, and the precedence order between CLI flags, the config file, and built-in defaults.

For *behavior* documentation (what the IME overlay feels like, recommended overrides, troubleshooting) see [`ime.md`](./ime.md). This page only covers the config-key surface itself.

## Location

| OS | Path |
|---|---|
| Linux | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/renga/config.toml` (default `~/.config/renga/config.toml`) |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/renga/config.toml` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\renga\config.toml` |

Missing or malformed files fall back to defaults with a stderr warning; renga never fails to start because of a config issue. Unknown sections and keys are ignored for forward-compat.

## Precedence

For every key that is also exposed as a CLI flag, the resolution order is:

**CLI flag > config file value > built-in default**

For `[ui] lang` the OS-locale detection step sits between the config file and the English fallback — see the table below.

## `[ime]` — IME composition overlay

```toml
[ime]
mode = "hotkey"               # "hotkey" | "off"
freeze_panes_on_overlay = true
overlay_catchup_ms = 3000
```

| Key | Type | Default | CLI flag | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `mode` | `"hotkey" \| "off"` | `"hotkey"` | `--ime <hotkey\|off>` | `hotkey` binds `Ctrl+;` (with `Alt+;` / `Alt+I` as fallbacks for terminals that swallow `Ctrl+;`). `off` swallows `Ctrl+;` silently — useful when the host terminal already places IME candidates correctly. |
| `freeze_panes_on_overlay` | bool | `true` | `--ime-freeze-panes[=BOOL]` | While the overlay is open, freeze pane repaints so Claude's streaming tokens don't flicker past your IME candidates. Only takes effect while the overlay is open, so non-IME users never see a behavior change. Pass `=false` to force live repaints during composition. |
| `overlay_catchup_ms` | u64 ms | `3000` | `--ime-overlay-catchup-ms <MS>` | When the freeze is active, force a single repaint every N ms so body-content progress stays visible. `0` is a pure freeze (no periodic catch-up). Non-zero values are clamped to at least `100`. |

> A third `mode` value, `"always"`, used to auto-open the overlay on every Claude pane focus. It was removed because the auto-open never worked reliably in practice. Users who want the overlay ready on focus should press `Ctrl+;` once.

## `[ui]` — UI language and event-loop rate

```toml
[ui]
lang = "auto"          # "auto" | "ja" | "en"
fps = 30
org_sidebar = "coexist" # "coexist" | "replace" | "off"
```

| Key | Type | Default | CLI flag | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `lang` | `"auto" \| "ja" \| "en"` | `"auto"` | `--lang <auto\|ja\|en>` | Language for status bar hints and preview panel error messages. `auto` detects from the OS locale via `sys-locale` (wraps `nl_langinfo` on Unix and `GetUserDefaultLocaleName` on Windows). Locales starting with `ja` render in Japanese; everything else falls back to English. Values are case-insensitive in both CLI and TOML. |
| `fps` | u16 | `30` | `--fps <FPS>` | Main event-loop target rate. Drives the crossterm poll timeout used while the TUI is idle; higher values reduce input latency and make animations smoother at the cost of more wakeups. `0` is clamped to `1` at runtime so a bad config or CLI override never turns into a busy-spin. |
| `org_sidebar` | `"coexist" \| "replace" \| "off"` | `"coexist"` | — (not yet exposed as a flag) | How the org sidebar (all-tabs overview + aggregated Claude activity state) relates to the file tree panel. `coexist` allows both panels to be shown at once; `replace` makes opening the org sidebar take over the file tree's panel slot instead; `off` disables the feature and its toggle key entirely. Values are case-insensitive in TOML. `coexist` and `replace` both open the panel at startup (`Ctrl+B` hides it for the session). On a terminal too narrow to fit everything the panel degrades last: the preview is dropped first, then the file tree, then the sidebar shrinks to a compact width, and only if the pane area would still fall below 20 columns is the sidebar hidden. |

Precedence:

- `lang` — CLI > config > OS locale detection > English fallback.
- `fps` — CLI > config > default (with the `0`→`1` clamp applied last).
- `org_sidebar` — config > default (no CLI override yet).
