# renga — Claude Code Multiplexer

> Renamed from `ccmux` (Issue #102, 2026-04). Historical references to the prior name are preserved in the upstream-fork notes below and in version-history comments in `Cargo.toml`.

## Overview
Rust TUI tool for managing multiple Claude Code instances in split panes.

## Fork Identity — read before touching names
The installed command is **`renga-cp`**, not `renga`, so this fork can sit next to upstream on one machine. Only the command is renamed. The following stay identical to upstream **on purpose** — do not "fix" them:

- **`renga-peers`** — the MCP server name. Claude derives `<channel source="renga-peers">` from this string, and `docs/api-surface-v1.0.md` freezes renaming it as a breaking change.
- **`RENGA_*`** env vars, **`~/.config/renga/`**, the IPC socket directory, and layout-TOML keys.
- The product name **renga** in prose. This is a fork of renga, not a different product.

Known consequence: `renga mcp install` (upstream) and `renga-cp mcp install` (this fork) write the same `renga-peers` registration and overwrite each other. Register whichever one you actually drive agents with.

## Tech Stack
- Rust (stable), ratatui + crossterm, portable-pty, vt100

## Build & Run
```bash
cargo build          # Debug build
cargo build --release # Release build
cargo test           # Run tests
cargo run            # Run the app
```

## Architecture
- `main.rs` — Entry point, terminal setup, event loop
- `app.rs` — App state, event dispatching, layout tree
- `pane.rs` — PTY management, vt100 terminal emulation, shell detection
- `ui.rs` — ratatui rendering, layout calculation, theme
- `filetree.rs` — File tree sidebar
- `preview.rs` — File preview panel

## Key Design Decisions
- **vt100 crate** for terminal emulation (not ANSI stripping) — needed for Claude Code's interactive UI
- **Binary tree layout** for recursive pane splitting
- **Per-PTY reader threads** with mpsc channel to main event loop
- PTY resize via both `master_pty.resize()` and `vt100_parser.set_size()`

## Shell Detection Priority
- Windows: Git Bash → PowerShell
- Unix: $SHELL → /bin/sh

## Release Process
配布は **GitHub Release のみ**。npm には publish しない (`npm/` ディレクトリごと削除済み。上流の Trusted Publishing は上流のパッケージとリポジトリに紐付いておりフォークに引き継げないため)。

1. `Cargo.toml` のバージョンを上げる (揃える相手だった `npm/package.json` は無い)
2. PR で `main` に merge (ブランチ保護は無いので直 push もできるが、CI を通すため PR 推奨)
3. `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z`
4. CI (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) が自動で実行:
   - 4プラットフォーム (Windows x64, macOS x64/arm64, Linux x64) のリリースビルド
   - GitHub Release 作成 + checksums.txt 生成
   - 成果物名は `renga-cp-*` (バイナリ名に合わせている)

### タグ命名
- 通常は **`vX.Y.Z` (plain semver)**。これで GitHub Release が stable になる。
- 先行公開したい場合だけ `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` / `-beta.N` / `-alpha.N` 等を使う。workflow が `ref_name` に `-` を含むかで自動的に prerelease に振り分ける。
- 上流 renga のバージョン番号とは同期させない。

### やってはいけない
- **手動で `gh release create` しないこと** — タグ push で workflow が作るものと衝突する

## Fork & Branching (Divergence Policy)
This repository (`knmgn/renga`) is a fork of `suisya-systems/renga`, which is itself a fork of `Shin-sibainu/ccmux` — three levels:

```
Shin-sibainu/ccmux  →  suisya-systems/renga  →  knmgn/renga (here)
```

It adds GitHub Copilot CLI support and is developed as an **independent main line**. There is no periodic upstream sync; useful upstream changes are pulled in only as ad-hoc, per-commit cherry-picks when explicitly requested. `BRANCHING.md` is the source of truth — see it for the full policy.

Key points:
- `origin` is `knmgn/renga`; `upstream` is `suisya-systems/renga`. The original ccmux is not a configured remote by default.
- `main` — this fork's mainline (default branch, release target). Evolves independently of upstream.
- `master` — snapshot mirror kept only as a base for cherry-picks. Never carries fork-specific commits.
- Upstream changes enter this fork only via cherry-pick of specific commits the user has named. No blanket sync.
- `.claude/skills/upstream-sync/` skill assists with those ad-hoc cherry-pick and reverse-PR procedures. It must NOT fire on generic "sync the fork" / "merge in upstream" requests — push back to the user instead.

**Do not propose or open reverse PRs against upstream unless the user explicitly asks for one.** It is fine to label individual features as "potentially generalizable upstream" on an umbrella issue, but do not queue "open an upstream PR" as a follow-up task on your own — renga's progress should not be gated on upstream's review cadence.

## Intentional `ccmux` References (post-rename)
Issue #102 renamed the project from `ccmux` to `renga`. The following residual references to `ccmux` are intentional and should NOT be swept:

- **Upstream attribution** — the project descends from `Shin-sibainu/ccmux` via `suisya-systems/renga`. Mentions of either upstream by name in `BRANCHING.md`, `README*`, `lp/*.html`, and `docs/content/` are preserved.
- **Version-history comments in `Cargo.toml`** — pre-rename release notes describe past versions accurately; rewriting them would falsify history.
- **`.claude/` agent and skill files** — worker tooling, not user-facing product surface; outside the rename scope.
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml` historical mention** — none deliberately retained; if any remain they should be flagged.

## Workflow Rules
- **Every implementation must be reviewed by the evaluator agent** before reporting done. This is a Rust TUI app, so Playwright MCP is not available — the evaluator should perform static review (diff analysis, edge cases, logic correctness, key conflict checks, layout math consistency).
- **Run `cargo fmt --all` before committing.** CI's `rustfmt` job fails fast on unformatted code, so an unformatted commit costs an extra push-and-wait cycle. The repo ships a `.githooks/pre-commit` that enforces this; enable it with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` once after cloning.
